    Orchestrate the full process for creating a thought-leadership article on the topic: '{topic}'.
    Your plan is as follows:
    1.  Delegate the task of refining the topic and finding the top 3 research links to the `TopicStrategyAgent`. When delegating, ensure the 'task' and 'context' arguments are provided as simple, plain strings, NOT as dictionaries or JSON objects.
    2.  Once you receive the links, delegate the task of reading those links and creating a comprehensive research summary to the `ContentResearchAgent`. When delegating, ensure the 'task' and 'context' arguments are provided as simple, plain strings, NOT as dictionaries or JSON objects.
    3.  Once you have the research summary, delegate the final writing task to the `WriterAgent` to produce the two-page article. When delegating, ensure the 'task' and 'context' arguments are provided as simple, plain strings, NOT as dictionaries or JSON objects.
    Ensure you pass the necessary information between each step. Your final output must be the completed article from the `WriterAgent`.
  expected_output: The final, polished, two-page article as a single block of text.
